# TB Lung Image Predictor

This is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application for predicting the presence of Tuberculosis in X-ray lung images. The application leverages TensorFlow for model inference, PIL for image processing, and Tkinter for the GUI.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface to load and analyze lung images.
- **TensorFlow Inference:** Utilizes TensorFlow Lite for fast and efficient model prediction.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Displays the lung image and prediction result immediately after selection.
- **Custom Styling:** Modern and visually appealing design using Tkinter's `ttk` widgets and themes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/07umar07/Tuberculosis-Detector.git
    cd Tuberculosis-Detector
    ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    `requirements.txt` includes the following libraries:
    - numpy
    - tensorflow
    - matplotlib
    - imblearn
    - scikit-learn
    - pillow
    - tkinter (if not already included in your Python installation)

## Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Run the notebook:**
    - Navigate to the directory where the `.ipynb` file is located.
    - Open the notebook in your browser.
    - Run the cells in the notebook to execute the application.

3. **Using the interface:**
    - Click on the "Choose the Image" button to open a file dialog.
    - Select a lung image file from your directory.
    - The selected image and prediction result will be displayed on the GUI.

## Code Overview

- **TBCDetector.ipynb:** The main script that includes model training and testing.
- **Test.ipynb:** The testing script includes the GUI setup and prediction test.

### Main Functions

- `output_predict(X)`: Takes in image data as input, processes it through the TensorFlow Lite model, and returns the prediction result.
- `load_image(img_path)`: Loads and preprocesses the image for model prediction.
- `on_drop()`: Handles the image selection process, updates the GUI with the image and prediction result.

### GUI Setup

The GUI is created using Tkinter's `ttk` widgets and styled with a custom theme for a modern look. It includes a button to choose an image, and frames to display the selected image and prediction result.
